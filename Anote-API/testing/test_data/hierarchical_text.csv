Great product, really enjoyed using it.
The quality was poor and it broke after a few uses.
Fast shipping, item as described. Would buy again.
Not as described. Very disappointed.
Excellent customer service.
The size was too small, even though I followed the size chart.
The color was not as shown in the picture.
Very comfortable and fits perfectly.
The sound quality is amazing.
The battery life is not as good as advertised.
It stopped working after a month.
It's a bit expensive, but worth every penny.
The fabric is soft and comfortable.
It's easy to use and setup.
The picture quality is excellent.
It's not worth the price.
