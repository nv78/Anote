3M_2022_10K,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","Operating margin changes for 3M in FY2022 were affected by several key factors. 

First, the increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales due to significant costs. These included special item costs associated with significant litigation related to resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, which led to a substantial pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion in the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, the company faced certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs associated with exiting Russia, and divestiture-related restructuring charges. Furthermore, 3M continued to invest in key growth initiatives.

While these increases in expenses negatively impacted the operating margin, they were partially offset by restructuring benefits and ongoing general cost management by 3M.

Therefore, the combination of increased litigation, impairment, exit, and restructuring costs, offset to some extent by cost management and restructuring benefits, collectively drove the changes in operating margin for 3M in FY2022.",0.489111228,0.859728515,1
