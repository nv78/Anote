charges","SG&A, measured as a percent of sales, increased in 2022 when compared to the same period last year. SG&A was impacted by increased special item costs for significant
litigation primarily related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation (discussed in Note 16) resulting in a 2022 second quarter pre-tax charge of approximately
$1.2 billion, certain impairment costs related to exiting PFAS manufacturing (see Note 15), costs related to exiting Russia (see Note 15), divestiture-related restructuring

Current Health Ltd.
In fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Current Health Ltd. (“Current Health”), a care-at-home technology platform, on November 2, 2021, for
net cash consideration of $389 million. The acquired assets included $351 million of goodwill that was assigned to our Best Buy Health reporting unit and was
deductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition is aligned with our focus in virtual care to enable people in their homes to connect seamlessly with their
health care providers and is included in our Domestic reportable segment and Services revenue category. The acquisition was accounted for using the
acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and was not material to the results of operations.
Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture
In fiscal 2022, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Two Peaks, LLC d/b/a Yardbird Furniture (“Yardbird”), a direct-to-consumer outdoor furniture company,
on November 4, 2021, for net cash consideration of $79 million. The acquired assets included $47 million of goodwill that was assigned to our Best Buy Domestic
reporting unit and was deductible for income tax purposes. The acquisition expands our assortment in categories like outdoor living, as more and more
consumers look to make over or upgrade their outdoor living spaces. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting for business

Some notable legal dispute areas for CVS are: (1) usual and customary pricing litigation: where it's claimed that CVS’s retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs; (2) PBM litigation and investigations: where it's claimed that that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products; and (3) controlled substances litigation: legal matters around opioids for which CVS has agreed to pay up to $4.3 billion to claimants in remediation and $625 million to attorneys and fees","Usual and Customary Pricing Litigation
The Company and certain current and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company’s retail
pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___The Company is facing multiple lawsuits, including by state Attorneys General, governmental subdivisions and several putative class actions, regarding drug
pricing and its rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers. These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal
theories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___In December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a
leadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs’ Executive Committee (“PEC”). The agreement would resolve substantially all
opioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the
settlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys’ fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts
would be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023.","173,173,174",financial_statements/e4b97418-e95e-4391-b2d9-8c604c4950ac.pdf

2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan
We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage newtechnology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market andinformation systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize ourmanufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourthquarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities withinthe initiatives described above.
As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cashexpenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately
55% of severance andother employee-related costs, 10% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35%for other co
sts associated with the implementation of our initiatives.
The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows:

Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments, Licensing Arrangements and Collaborative
Arrangements
A. Acquisitions
Trillium
On November 17, 2021, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock not already owned by Pfizer of Trillium, a clinical stage
immuno-oncology company developing therapies targeting cancer immune evasion pathways and specific cell targeting approaches, for a
price of $18.50 per share in cash, for total consideration of $2.0 billion, net of cash acquired. As a result, Trillium became our wholly owned
subsidiary. We previously held a 2% ownership investment in Trillium. Trillium’s lead program, TTI-622, is an investigational fusion protein that
is designed to block the inhibitory activity of CD47, a molecule that is overexpressed by a wide variety of tumors.
We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset, TTI-622, represented substantially all of the fair value of the
gross assets acquired, which exclude cash acquired. At the acquisition date, we recorded a $2.1 billion charge representing an acquired
IPR&D asset with no alternative future use in Research and development expenses, of which the $2.0 billion net cash consideration is
presented as a cash outflow from operating activities. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded $256 million of assets acquired primarily
consisting of cash and investments. Liabilities assumed were approximately $81 million.
Array
On July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and
commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The
total fair value of the consideration transferred was $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). In addition, $157 million in payments to
Array employees for the fair value of previously unvested stock options was recognized as post-closing compensation expense and recorded
in Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs (see Note 3). We financed the majority of the transaction with debt and the
balance with existing cash.___FINANCEBENCH_DELIMITER___Therachon
On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare
diseases, with assets in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb
dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470 million contingent on the achievement of key milestones in
the development and commercialization of the lead asset. We accounted for the transaction as an asset acquisition since the lead asset
represented substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Therachon was
$322 million, which consisted of $317 million of cash and our previous $5 million investment in Therachon. In connection with this asset
acquisition, we recorded a charge of $337 million in Research and development expenses.","70, 71",financial_statements/fa35a206-5bac-4a7a-9571-1e194b4436b5.pdf
