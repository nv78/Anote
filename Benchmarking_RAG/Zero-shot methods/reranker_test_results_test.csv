3M_2022_10K,"What drove operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M? If operating margin is not a useful metric for a company like this, then please state that and explain why.","Operating Margin for 3M in FY2022 has decreased by 1.7% primarily due to: 
-Decrease in gross Margin
-mostly one-off charges including Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, impairment related to exiting PFAS manufacturing, costs related to exiting Russia and divestiture-related restructuring
charges","The operating margin change as of FY2022 for 3M can be linked to several critical factors. While the specific document sections on FY2022 operating margins aren't provided in the context, related impacts typically include changes in demand for products and disruptions in the global supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 3M's updated business segment operating performance measures, which no longer include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income, likely also contributed.

Hence, if those elements are taken into account:

- **Changes in Demand for Products**: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain product lines might have seen decreased demand, impacting overall sales and profitability.
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Global supply chain issues likely increased costs or delayed production, further affecting margins.
- **Segment Reporting Adjustments**: The removal of dual credit for sales and related operating income would impact the measure of segment profit, thereby influencing the consolidated operating margin.

These factors together paint a clear picture of the drivers behind changes in operating margins for 3M. Thus, operating margin is indeed a useful metric as it reflects the direct impacts of operational challenges faced during the fiscal year.",0.22399624632268345,0.807689905166626,0.0
